Introduction of EUC-Citrix lab track, user scenario is migrating VDI environment from Horizon View to Citrix/AHV, enabling user directories, profile management, flow, reporting.

If you have not previously completed the **Private Cloud** lab track, follow the quick instructions below to provision your user VLAN and Windows Tools VM that will be used throughout this lab track.

Configuring your User VLAN
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Typically, Hosted POC clusters provide 2x /25 VLANs. In order to provide adequate IP space and support lab requirements for Global Tech Summit, each cluster has been assigned an additional 8x /27 VLANs. The following instructions will walk you through configuring the VLAN you have been individually assigned, and should be used for the remaining labs in this track.

   .. note:: A /27 VLAN provides 32 IP addresses, 5 of which are reserved. You will therefore need to be conscious of cleaning up unneeded VMs to avoid running out of IP space.
