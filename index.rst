Nutanix Global Tech Summit
--------------------------

Welcome to Nutanix Global Tech Summit 2020!

<Need new copy on selecting a lab track and standalone labs>

Labs are designed to be completed by each individual, not in groups. Each Nutanix employee must complete a minimum of 1 solution track.

For each lab you complete & validate, you'll be entered into a raffle to win <prize selection>!

**Proctors will be regularly checking in with each table to validate completed labs. You do NOT need to wait for lab validation before proceeding to your next lab, but please take the time to clean up unneeded VMs after each lab validation.**

  <strong><font color="red">REVIEW THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS BEFORE BEGINNING ANY LABS:</font></strong>

- :ref:`clusteraccess` - *VPN configuration for accessing the Nutanix Hosted POC network*
- :ref:`clusterinfo` - *Your individual cluster assignment and details on how your cluster was staged*
- :ref:`validation` - *How to get assistance with a lab*
